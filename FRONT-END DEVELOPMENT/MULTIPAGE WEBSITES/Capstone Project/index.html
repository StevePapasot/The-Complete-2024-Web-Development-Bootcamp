    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>
        Greetings! I'm a Front-End Developer with an insatiable curiosity for the world of hacking. 
        My journey began in the realm of web development, where I craft seamless and visually captivating
        user interfaces using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. However, my passion extends beyond pixels 
        and codeâ€”I harbor a profound interest in ethical hacking. With a commitment to cybersecurity, 
        I constantly explore the dynamic intersection between creative design and secure functionality. 
        Leveraging my skills in both arenas, I strive to build digital experiences that not only captivate users 
        but also withstand the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity challenges. Join me on this exciting 
        journey where the artistry of front-end development meets the strategic thinking of ethical hacking, 
        forging a unique path in the tech landscape. Let's create not just beautiful websites, but robust 
        and secure digital environments.</p>
